# Emotion_detection_DL_model_from_images

Deep learning project in which 2 Deep learning models can be built, trained and saved for detecting emotions from `.png` images of human faces in gray-scale. It also includes a user interface.

## 📌 Features

- Emotion classification into 7 categories:
  - Anger 😠
  - Disgust 🤢
  - Fear 😱
  - Happy 😊
  - Neutral 😐
  - Sadness 😔
  - Surprise 😲
- Transfer learning in a custom CNN model
- No Transfer learning in a custom CNN model
- Real-time webcam emotion prediction (user interface)
- Automatic requirements.txt and dataset download from Kaggle (Must have credentials first)
- Configurable via `config_file.json`
- Logging to file and console
- Modular and reusable code structure

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Emotion_detection_DL_model_from_images.git
cd Emotion_detection_DL_model_from_images
```

### 2. Add your Kaggle API credentials
*You must be registered to kaggle and have your credentials somewhere locally*

Place your `kaggle.json` file in the appropriate location (e.g., `C:/Users/YourName/.kaggle/kaggle.json`).

### 3. Run the setup script

This installs dependencies and downloads the dataset:

```bash
python set_up/full_set_up.py
```

---

## 🧪 Usage

### Train the models

```bash
python dl_scripts/dl_model_no_transfer_learning.ipynb
```

and/or

```bash
python dl_scripts/dl_model_transfer_learning.ipynb
```

This will start building, training and saving the models in the root in a directory named 'trained_dl_models'
You can configure parameters like epochs, model name, dataset path, etc., inside `configuration/config_file.json`.

### User interface
Note: For the UI to work, you must first train the models by running one of the training scripts. The trained models will be saved in the trained_dl_models/ directory.

```bash
python user_interface/emotion_detection_UI.ipynb
```

## 🧠 Emotion Classes

The model is trained to detect the following emotions:

| Emotion   | Emoji |
|-----------|--------|
| Anger     | 👿     |
| Disgust   | 🤢     |
| Fear      | 😱     |
| Happy     | 😊     |
| Neutral   | 😐     |
| Sadness   | 😔     |
| Surprise  | 😲     |
